      <abstract>These GIS files represent geographic boundaries for lands that are under the
                protection of NYS Agricultural District Law, administered by the New York State
                Department of Agriculture and Markets. The boundaries are derived from New York
                State Agricultural District, 1:24,000-scale, maps produced at county agencies. The
                district boundaries correspond to tax parcel data. District boundaries are joined
                into a file representing all of the Agricultural Districts within an entire county.
                Tax parcel detail is not included in this dataset. Road and utility rights-of-way
                are only included when they are delineated on the original 1:24,000 scale maps. The
                data files are in ESRI shapefile format.</abstract>
      <purpose>A Geographic Information System (ArcGIS) file intended to represent the lands
                within agricultural district. Please note that boundaries may be generalizations;
                precise information can be obtained from the county or town tax parcel
                information.</purpose>
      <supplinf>An Agricultural District is defined by a list of tax parcels, including
                properties added during the annual open enrollment. The 1:24,000-scale maps are only
                updated to reflect open enrollment changes at the eight-year renewal of the
                district. The Agricultural District boundaries are for use in conjunction with NYS
                geographical data (ex. NYS Department of Transportation (DOT) 7.5' planimetric
                data). Boundary data is current to certification date of the district map on file at
                IRIS at the time the digital data was updated. The certification date is noted in
                the attribute table field called "Certified". Legislation in 2003 allows lands to be
                added to districts on an annual basis. Annual additions are not typically included
                in these shapefiles. When they are included, an additional field, “OEadds303b”, is
                included in the attribute table; dates of the annual additions are listed there.
                Electronic data provided here may predate newer additions. Refer to the current tax
                parcel list for each district to confirm the precise agricultural district boundary.

    <datacred>Cornell IRIS maintains the county produced Agricultural District maps on file
            under contract with the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. In 1996
            the maps on file at Cornell IRIS (then CLEARS) were scanned at the NYSDEC as the initial
            step in creating a digital database of Ag District Boundaries.</datacred>

      <attraccr>The attributes were visually compared to original source map title blocks and

    <logic>Boundary data reflect Agricultural District boundaries as displayed on 1:24,000-scale
            maps. When boundaries show areas contained mutually in more than one district in the
            same county, electronic data reflect this as an overlap. If individual tax parcels are
            dissolved to form an aggregate boundary, slivers and gaps may be formed by drafting
            discrepancies. These are visually compared to the map and eliminated when they do not
            represent intended exclusions. If the map is unclear, the county is contacted to confirm
            intent. District boundary shapefile data is printed out using DOT planimetric raster
            data as a base, then proofread against the maps.</logic>
    <complete>County Agricultural District boundaries are complete to the extent that the
            original map is complete. Tax parcel detail is not included in this dataset.
            Rights-of-way for roads, railroads and utilities are only included when they are
            delineated on the original 1:24,000 scale maps. NOTE: The most current and precise
            boundary of a district should be verified by referring to the tax parcel information at
            county agencies.</complete>

        <procdesc>1) ORIGINAL SCAN PROJECT In 1996, the entire set of NYS Agricultural
                    District maps in the collection of Cornell IRIS (originally CLEARS) was
                    converted to digital format. This was done by shipping blueprint copies of the
                    maps to the NYS DEC for scanning. Digital Line Graph files were returned, which
                    were converted to ArcInfo Coverages. These coverages represented one map sheet
                    apiece. Original maps with multiple sheets were represented by multiple
                    coverages. Coverages were compared to the original maps and edited as necessary
                    to create an accurate representation of the Ag District boundaries shown on the
                    maps. After accuracy was confirmed, coverages representing multiple sheets were
                    merged to create district coverages. Districts were then merged to create county
                    coverages. Merged districts sometimes created slivers, which were eliminated,
                    and gaps, which are flagged with district value of zero. Overlaps between
                    districts also occurred in a few cases. These were flagged with district value
                    "66". For each coverage, an attribute table was built to record the information
                    shown on the Cornell IRIS title block of each Ag District hardcopy map. These
                    tables are further described in the Entity and Attribute Information section of
                    the metadata.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>2) CONVERSION FROM COVERAGES TO SHAPEFILES: Internal polygons were labeled
                    zero; coverages were reprojected from UTMz18 NAD27 to UTMz18 NAD83; Coverages
                    were converted to shapefiles; zero polygons were deleted; attribute table was
                    modified: deleted fields are AREA, PERIMETER, FILE#, FILE_ID, AGDIST#, DOTQUADS.
                    Modified fields are DISTCODE and DISTRICT. DISTCODE is 12 characters to
                    accommodate changing abbreviations -- currently four characters and three digits
                    to represent a key code for county name and district number. The field DISTRICT
                    was enlarged to accommodate district numbers up to five digits. Also, DISTCODE,
                    the key field, was moved to the end of the attribute table columns.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>3) UPDATING COUNTY BOUNDARY DATA: County shapefiles are updated to reflect
                    modifications that occurred during the eight-year review process. Boundaries are
                    revised using one or more of the three methods: Tablet digitizing; On-screen
                    digitizing; Copying boundaries from county-supplied shapefiles. All
                    modifications are proofread against the original maps to confirm accuracy.
                    Attributes are updated and checked against the information on the map title
                    blocks, as well as information on file. If individual tax parcels are dissolved
                    to form an aggregate boundary, slivers and gaps may be formed by drafting
                    discrepancies. These are visually compared to the map and eliminated when they
                    do not represent intended exclusions. Discrepancies between the title block
                    information and file information are clarified by contacting the county and/or
                    New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets.</procdesc>
